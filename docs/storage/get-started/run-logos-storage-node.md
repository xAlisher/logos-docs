# Run a Logos storage node

#### Get started running a Logos storage node and uploading your first file to the Logos network.

This procedure covers how to build and run the [Logos Storage Module](https://github.com/logos-co/logos-storage-module/), connect it to the testnet bootstrap nodes, publish a file, and verify that the file can be downloaded. It is intended for node operators on testnet v0.2 who want to contribute storage capacity to the Logos network.

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- Linux (tested on Ubuntu 22.04)
- **Nix** with flakes enabled. Install from [nixos.org](https://nixos.org/download.html), then enable flakes:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.config/nix
    echo 'experimental-features = nix-command flakes' >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
    ```
-   The [`logoscore`](https://github.com/logos-co/logos-logoscore-cli) daemon CLI and the [`lgpm`](https://github.com/logos-co/logos-package-manager) package manager, built from their flakes:

    ```bash
    nix build 'github:logos-co/logos-logoscore-cli' --out-link ./logos
    nix build 'github:logos-co/logos-package-manager#cli' -o lgpm
    export PATH="$PWD/logos/bin:$PWD/lgpm/bin:$PATH"
    ```

    {% hint style="info" %}

    Build the tools with Nix rather than using the prebuilt releases: the storage module package built from source in the next section provides a `linux-amd64-dev` platform variant that older release builds of `lgpm` do not recognise.

    {% endhint %}
- `jq` on your `PATH` — used to pull the uploaded [CID](https://docs.logos.co/get-started/glossary#cid) out of the manifests JSON. Verify: `jq --version`

## What to expect

- You can connect a [Logos Storage](https://docs.logos.co/get-started/glossary#logos-storage) node to the testnet and have it listed among the bootstrap peers.
- You can publish a file to the network and retrieve a content address to share with other nodes.
- You can download the file back from the network and confirm it lands on disk.

## Build and install the storage module

1.  Build the [module](https://docs.logos.co/get-started/glossary#module) package with Nix:

    ```sh
    nix build 'github:logos-co/logos-storage-module/v2.0.1#lgx' -o storage-lgx
    ```

    - This produces a `logos-storage_module-module-lib.lgx` package in `./storage-lgx/`.

    {% hint style="info" %}

    The initial Nix build takes 15–20 minutes on first run. Subsequent builds use the Nix cache and complete in seconds.

    {% endhint %}
2.  Install the package into a local modules directory using `lgpm`. The package is a local build and is unsigned, so pass `--allow-unsigned`:

    ```sh
    mkdir -p modules
    lgpm --modules-dir ./modules --allow-unsigned install --file storage-lgx/*.lgx
    ```
3.  Confirm the module landed:

    ```sh
    lgpm --modules-dir ./modules list
    # storage_module appears in the listing
    ```

## Start the daemon and load the storage module

Run `logoscore` with the modules directory, then load and initialise the [storage module](https://docs.logos.co/get-started/glossary#storage-module) against the testnet config.

Several module calls in this procedure are **asynchronous**: the call returns `"result":true` as soon as the command is accepted, and the real outcome arrives later as an event in the daemon log (`storageStart`, `storageUploadDone`, `storageDownloadDone`, `storageRemoveDone`). This is why the daemon is started with its output captured to `logs.txt`, and why the steps below check that file.

1.  Start the `logoscore` daemon in background mode, capturing its output:

    ```sh
    logoscore -D -m ./modules > logs.txt 2>&1 &
    ```

    - The client subcommands below connect to this running process via the config written under `~/.logoscore/`.
2.  Verify the daemon is running:

    ```sh
    logoscore status
    ```
3.  Confirm the storage module was discovered:

    ```sh
    logoscore list-modules
    # storage_module appears in the list
    ```
4.  Load the storage module and confirm it reports `loaded`:

    ```sh
    logoscore load-module storage_module
    logoscore status
    # storage_module now shows "status":"loaded"
    ```

    - To see every method the module exposes (the same methods you can `call`), run `logoscore module-info storage_module`.
5.  Create the storage config. Use **absolute** paths: in daemon mode the module runs as its own process, whose working directory is not the one you are typing in, so relative paths resolve to the wrong place. The `$(pwd)` in the heredoc takes care of it:

    ```sh
    mkdir -p "$(pwd)/storage-data"
    cat > config.json <<EOF
    {
      "data-dir": "$(pwd)/storage-data",
      "log-level": "DEBUG",
      "log-file": "$(pwd)/storage-data/storage.log",
      "nat": "none"
    }
    EOF
    ```

    - With `"nat": "none"` the node announces the machine's own IP as-is: it can download from the network but is not reachable from the internet from behind a router. To make it reachable, use `"nat": "upnp"` or `"nat": "extip:<your-public-IP>"` with the ports forwarded: see [Connectivity](../concepts/connectivity.md).

    - `config.json` includes the following fields:

    | Field         | Purpose                      |
    | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
    | `data-dir`    | Storage repository path (absolute) |
    | `log-level`   | Log verbosity                |
    | `log-file`    | Node log destination (absolute) |
    | `listen-ip`   | Local TCP bind address       |
    | `listen-port` | Public TCP libp2p port       |
    | `disc-port`   | Public UDP discovery port    |
    | `nat`         | Public IP advertisement mode — see [Connectivity](../concepts/connectivity.md) |
    | `network`     | Storage network preset       |

    - Use fixed `listen-port` and `disc-port`; do not leave public nodes on random ports.
    - The `logos.test` preset provides the storage bootstrap settings.

6.  Initialise the storage module with the testnet configuration. `init` is synchronous and returns `true` on success (the `@config.json` syntax loads the file's contents as the argument):

    ```sh
    logoscore call storage_module init @config.json
    ```
7.  Start the node. `start` is asynchronous: the return value only confirms the command was accepted; the real outcome is the `storageStart` event in the daemon log:

    ```sh
    logoscore call storage_module start
    # Wait few seconds to start
    ```
8.  Inspect the running node with `debug`. It returns the node's identity: its `id` (peer ID) and its `spr`, the signed record other nodes use to connect to you (see [Connectivity](../concepts/connectivity.md)):

    ```sh
    logoscore call storage_module debug
    ```

## Publish and download a file

Once the node is running and connected to the testnet, publish a file and verify the round-trip.

1.  Upload a file to the network with `uploadUrl`. It takes an **absolute** path and a chunk size in bytes, and returns immediately; the upload runs in the background and completes with a `storageUploadDone` event:

    ```sh
    logoscore call storage_module uploadUrl "$(pwd)/logs.txt" 65536
    ```

    {% hint style="info" %}

    The default chunk size is 65536.

    {% endhint %}
2.  Extract the content ID (CID) from the first `manifests` entry:

    ```sh
    logoscore call storage_module manifests \
       | jq -er '.result.value[0].cid' > cid.txt
    ```
3.  Download the file back from the network with `downloadToUrl`. It takes the CID, an **absolute** destination path, a `local` flag, and a chunk size in bytes. Like `uploadUrl` it runs in the background and completes with a `storageDownloadDone` event:

    ```sh
    logoscore call storage_module downloadToUrl "$(cat cid.txt)" "$(pwd)/logs-destination.txt" true 65536
    ```

    - The `local` flag reads only from locally cached data when set to `true`; `false` fetches from the network.

4.  Confirm the downloaded file is present at the destination path and matches the original. You can also check the content is in local storage by CID:

    ```sh
    logoscore call storage_module exists "$(cat cid.txt)"
    # returns true
    ```

## Remove content and shut everything down

To clear your local storage, destroy the storage node, and stop the daemon, follow the steps below.

1.  Remove content from local storage by its CID. `remove` returns immediately; the outcome arrives as a `storageRemoveDone` event:

    ```sh
    logoscore call storage_module remove "$(cat cid.txt)"
    ```
2.  Confirm the content is gone:

    ```sh
    logoscore call storage_module exists "$(cat cid.txt)" | jq '.result.value'
    # false
    ```
3.  Stop the storage node. `stop` is asynchronous like `start`; a `storageStop` event follows in the log. The node can be started and stopped multiple times:

    ```sh
    logoscore call storage_module stop
    ```
4.  Destroy the storage context. `destroy` is synchronous and must be called after the node is stopped:

    ```sh
    logoscore call storage_module destroy
    ```
5.  Stop the daemon and confirm it has exited:

    ```sh
    logoscore stop
    # Wait 5 seconds
    logoscore status
    # reports "status":"not_running"
    ```

## Troubleshooting Logos Storage

Connectivity problems (downloads timing out from another machine, no peers, unreachable node) are covered in the [FAQ](faq.md) and in [Connectivity](../concepts/connectivity.md).
