# About peer exchange

#### Understand how light nodes request peers from other nodes without relying on Discv5.

The primary objective of this protocol is to facilitate peer connectivity for resource-limited devices without relying on `Discv5`. The [peer exchange](https://docs.logos.co/get-started/glossary#peer-exchange) protocol enables [light nodes](https://docs.logos.co/get-started/glossary#light-node) to request peers from other nodes within the network.

{% hint style="info" %}

`Peer Exchange` enables requesting random peers from other network nodes without revealing information about their connectivity or neighbourhood.

{% endhint %}

## How peer exchange works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>DNS Server: (1) Execute DNS Discovery
    DNS Server-->>Alice: (2) Bob's multiaddr (websocket)
    Alice-->>Bob: (3) Dial
    Alice->>Bob: (4) Peer Exchange Query
    Bob-->>Alice: (5) Carol's ENR, David's ENR
    Alice->>Alice: (6) Decode ENRs
    Alice->>Carol: (7) Dial
    Alice->>David: (7) Dial
    Alice-->>Bob: (8) Disconnect
```

1. [DNS Discovery](https://docs.logos.co/get-started/glossary#dns-discovery) protocol is executed.
1. Alice retrieves Bob's websocket multiaddr from DNS Server.
1. Alice dials Bob using libp2p protocols.
1. Alice executes a Peer Exchange query to Bob.
1. Bob returns Carol's and David's [ENR](https://docs.logos.co/get-started/glossary#enr) to Alice.
1. Alice decodes ENRs and extracts Carol's and David's websocket multiaddrs.
1. Alice dials Carol and David.
1. Alice can now drop the connection with Bob (bootstrap node); Alice has 2 connections to the [Logos Delivery](https://docs.logos.co/get-started/glossary#logos-delivery) Network.

## Pros and cons

Pros:

- Low resource requirements.
- Decentralised with random sampling of nodes from a global view using `Discv5`.

Cons:

- Decreased anonymity.
- Imposes additional load on responder nodes.
